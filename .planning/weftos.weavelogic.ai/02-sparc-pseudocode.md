## Execution Order

```
Sprint 1 (Foundation)     → Can ship independently, highest impact
Sprint 2 (Docs Structure) → Unblocks Sprint 3
Sprint 3 (Quickstart)     → Depends on Sprint 2 for /docs index
Sprint 4 (Content)        → Independent of Sprints 1-3
Sprint 5 (Polish)         → Final pass after content is stable
```

## Total Estimated Effort: 16-23 hours across 5 sprints
