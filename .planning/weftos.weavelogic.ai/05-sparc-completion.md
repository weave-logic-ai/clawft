## Post-Completion Review

After all 5 sprints are deployed:

1. **Re-run 5-second test**: Does a visitor understand WeftOS's value in 5 seconds?
2. **Time the quickstart**: Can a new developer go from zero to running in < 5 minutes?
3. **Cross-site check**: Can a visitor navigate between weavelogic.ai and weftos.weavelogic.ai seamlessly?
4. **Competitive comparison**: Does the site hold up against LangChain/CrewAI landing pages?
5. **Messaging consistency**: Are the same terms and positioning used across both sites?

### Success Criteria (from Specification)
- [ ] 5-second comprehension: 4/5 (was 2/5)
- [ ] Time to first hello world: < 2 min (was 15+ min)
- [ ] Landing page CTAs: 2 (was 0)
- [ ] /docs returns 200 (was 404)
- [ ] HTML title: "WeftOS" (was "clawft")
- [ ] Cross-site navigation: bidirectional (was none)
- [ ] Messaging score: 7+/10 (was 3.0/10)
- [ ] UX heuristic average: 4.0/5 (was 3.5/5)
