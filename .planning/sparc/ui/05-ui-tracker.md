- [ ] **S3 Complete (Week 9)**: Delegation monitor + pipeline inspector + cost tracker, advanced Canvas (charts, Monaco, forms, history, export), mobile responsive + PWA, Tauri desktop shell, production hardening (CSP, rate limiting, E2E tests, accessibility, Tailscale auth, multi-user)

### MVP Verification Checklist

- [ ] Axum REST API serves /api/agents, /api/sessions, /api/tools
- [ ] Bearer token auth rejects unauthenticated requests with 401
- [ ] WebSocket /ws accepts connections with topic subscription
- [ ] `weft ui` command starts gateway and opens browser with token
- [ ] `pnpm dev` starts Vite dev server on :5173 with HMR
- [ ] `VITE_MOCK_API=true pnpm dev` runs fully without backend
- [ ] MSW mocks return realistic fixture data for agents, sessions, tools
- [ ] Dashboard displays agent count, channel status, recent sessions
- [ ] WebChat shows real-time streaming messages via WebSocket
- [ ] Agent start/stop actions update status via API
