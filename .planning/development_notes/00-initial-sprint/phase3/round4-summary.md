## Key Decision: WASM Target Change

Changed from `wasm32-wasip2` to `wasm32-wasip1` because:
- `wasm32-wasip2` std lib requires Rust 1.87+ (we're on 1.85)
- `wasm32-wasip1` works with Rust 1.85
- The Platform trait implementations don't use WASI preview2 features yet
- Will upgrade to wasip2 when Rust toolchain is updated

## Key Decision: WASM Dependency Decoupling

Removed clawft-core and clawft-platform from clawft-wasm deps because:
- clawft-platform pulls tokio["full"] which doesn't compile for WASM
- clawft-core pulls clawft-llm -> reqwest which has WASM issues
- clawft-wasm now only depends on clawft-types (compiles clean for wasip1)
- WASM platform implementations are self-contained stubs
- Will bridge back to Platform trait when real WASI impls are ready

---

## Objectives

Round 4 addresses the two critical blockers discovered during Round 3:

1. **WASM compilation fails** -- `wasm32-wasip2` requires Rust 1.87+ which we don't have. Switching to `wasm32-wasip1` and decoupling heavy deps from `clawft-wasm`.
2. **CI/CD hardening** -- wasm-build.yml needs updating for the new target, benchmark regression detection scripts need creation, and release packaging needs end-to-end validation.

### Specific Goals

1. Get `cargo check --target wasm32-wasip1 -p clawft-wasm` passing cleanly
2. Fix `.github/workflows/wasm-build.yml` to use `wasm32-wasip1`
3. Add dlmalloc as the WASM allocator (replacing talc, which was the previous plan)
4. Create benchmark regression detection scripts with threshold-based alerts
5. Validate release packaging end-to-end (build, package, checksum, verify)
6. Review and enhance CLI integration test coverage
7. Perform comprehensive exit criteria gap analysis
8. Update all development notes (this document)

## Changes from Round 3

### What Was Completed in Round 3

| Deliverable | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Benchmark report with real data | `report_benchmarks.md` populated -- 3.5ms startup, 4.6MB binary, 418 inv/s |
| CLI integration tests | `clawft/tests/cli_integration.rs` with assert_cmd |
| Release packaging scripts | `clawft/scripts/release-package.sh` |
| Deployment documentation | `clawft/docs/deployment/docker.md`, `wasm.md`, `release.md` |
| Crate metadata polish | All 9 Cargo.toml files updated with keywords, categories, descriptions |
| Security reference documentation | `clawft/docs/security.md` |
| CHANGELOG | `clawft/CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog format |
| Development notes | `round3-summary.md`, `phase3-status.md`, `cicd-progress.md` |

### What Round 3 Revealed

- `wasm32-wasip2` target cannot build std on Rust 1.85 (needs 1.87+)
- `clawft-wasm` dependency chain pulls in tokio and reqwest which don't compile for WASM
- Benchmark regression detection was deferred from Round 3 scope
- Release packaging script exists but needs end-to-end validation
