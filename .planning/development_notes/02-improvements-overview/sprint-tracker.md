**Project**: clawft
**Sprint**: Phase 5 -- Improvements Sprint
**Source**: `.planning/improvements.md`

**Test Baseline**: 2,075+ tests at sprint start
**Created**: 2026-02-19

## Milestone Status

- [ ] **MVP (Week 8)**: Plugin system (C1-C4) with skill precedence + hot-reload, email channel (E2), multi-agent routing (L1), 3 ported OpenClaw skills, F9a minimal MCP client, Claude Flow integration (M1-M3), all critical/high fixes (A1-A9) resolved, architecture cleanup (B1-B9) complete
- [ ] **Full Vision (Week 12)**: Browser automation, dev tool suite, F9b full MCP client, ClawHub with vector search, per-agent sandboxing, security plugin, Docker images, CI/CD pipeline, all forward-compat hooks for voice and UI in place

### MVP Verification Checklist
- [x] security-review passes without any p0.
- [x] `cargo test --workspace` passes with zero failures
- [x] `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` produces no warnings
- [x] Binary size < 10 MB (release build, default features)
- [x] Gateway starts, accepts email message, routes to agent, agent responds
- [x] `weft skill install` loads skill, tools appear in MCP `tools/list` -- verified: skill__prompt-log in tools/list (`78b3101`)
- [ ] Hot-reload: modify `SKILL.md`, verify tool list updates -- code complete, needs live integration test
- [ ] FlowDelegator: delegate task to Claude Code -- code complete, needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exported or in providers config (`78b3101` adds config fallback)
- [ ] MCP client (F9a): connect to external MCP server -- transport code works, needs running MCP server endpoint

## Out of Scope Items (Tracked for Reference)

| Item | Workstream | Reason | Future Track |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| G (Voice) | G | Deferred to post-sprint | `voice_development.md` |
| K1 (Web Dashboard + Live Canvas) | K | Deferred to post-sprint | `ui_development.md` |
| K6 (Native Shells) | K | Deferred to post-sprint | `ui_development.md` |

**Forward-compatibility hooks** (in scope, tracked under C1/C7):
- [ ] C1 defines `VoiceHandler` trait placeholder
- [ ] Plugin manifest reserves `voice` capability type
- [ ] `ChannelAdapter` trait supports binary/audio payloads
- [ ] Feature flag `voice` wired as no-op in Cargo.toml
- [ ] Agent loop and bus support structured/binary payloads (for future UI)
- [ ] MCP server tool schemas stable for future dashboard introspection
- [ ] Config and session APIs read-accessible without agent loop
