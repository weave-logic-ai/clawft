## 1. Business Requirements Summary

### What Is clawft

clawft is the Rust rewrite of nanobot, a ~10,000-line Python personal AI assistant framework. nanobot supports 9 chat channels, 14 LLM providers, a tool system, memory/session management, cron scheduling, and MCP integration. clawft produces a single static binary (`weft`) that replaces the Python + pip + Node.js stack (200+ MB footprint) with a < 15 MB native executable.

### Primary Goals

| ID | Goal | Success Metric |
|----|------|----------------|
| G1 | Single static binary for all platforms | `cargo build --release` produces one `weft` executable, no runtime deps |
| G2 | Run on constrained devices | Idle RSS < 10 MB on ARM64, < 5 MB WASM |
| G3 | Sub-second cold start | < 500ms to first message processing |
| G4 | Feature-gated compilation | Binary includes only enabled channels/providers |
| G5 | Config compatibility | Reads existing `~/.nanobot/config.json` without migration |
| G6 | Pluggable channel architecture | All channels implemented as plugins behind a common trait |
| G7 | RVF-powered intelligence | Model routing + vector memory via RVF |

### Secondary Goals

| ID | Goal | Success Metric |
|----|------|----------------|
| G8 | WASM core extraction | Core agent loop compiles to wasm32-wasip2, < 300 KB gzipped |
| G9 | Cross-compilation | CI builds for linux-x86_64, linux-aarch64, macos-arm64, windows-x86_64 |
| G10 | Embeddable library | `clawft-core` usable as a Rust library crate |
| G11 | Drop-in replacement | `weft` CLI has same commands and flags as Python `nanobot` |

### Non-Goals

- GUI or web dashboard
- Multi-tenancy or user management
- Dynamic plugin loading (`.so`/`.dll` at runtime) -- compile-time feature flags only
- WhatsApp channel in initial release
- Chinese platform channels (Feishu, DingTalk, Mochat, QQ)

### Target Users

1. **Self-Hoster** (Primary): Runs on VPS/home server, 1-3 channels, wants zero-dep deployment
2. **IoT/Edge Developer**: Raspberry Pi or similar, minimal binary, low RAM
3. **Developer/Contributor**: Extends with custom skills/tools/channel plugins

### Hard Constraints

1. Standalone within `repos/nanobot/` -- NOT in the barni Cargo workspace
2. Config compatibility with `~/.nanobot/config.json` (Python pydantic model)
3. Session compatibility with `~/.nanobot/sessions/*.jsonl`
4. Workspace compatibility with `~/.nanobot/workspace/` layout
5. No new external services (no databases, Redis, Docker required)
6. MIT license for all dependencies
7. Every channel MUST implement the `Channel` trait

---

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Workspace Structure (9 Crates)

```
repos/nanobot/clawft/
  Cargo.toml                  # Workspace root
  crates/
    clawft-types/             # Zero-dep core types (serde only)
    clawft-platform/          # Platform abstraction (HTTP, FS, Env, Process)
    clawft-core/              # Agent loop, context, memory, skills, bus, pipeline
    clawft-llm/               # Standalone LLM provider library (HTTP transport)
    clawft-tools/             # Built-in tools (feature-gated)
    clawft-channels/          # Channel plugin host + Telegram/Slack/Discord plugins
    clawft-services/          # Cron, heartbeat, MCP client
    clawft-cli/               # Native CLI binary (`weft`)
    clawft-wasm/              # WASM entrypoint (optional)
```

### Crate Dependency Graph

```
clawft-types          (zero deps beyond serde)
    |
clawft-platform       (depends on: types)
    |
clawft-llm            (standalone library: reqwest, serde, async-trait)
    |
clawft-core           (depends on: types, platform, clawft-llm)
    |
    +-- clawft-tools       (depends on: types, platform, core)
    +-- clawft-channels    (depends on: types, platform, core)
    +-- clawft-services    (depends on: types, platform, core)
    |
clawft-cli            (depends on: all above) -> binary: `weft`
clawft-wasm           (depends on: types, serde) -- decoupled from core/platform
```

### Platform Abstraction Traits

Four core traits enable WASM portability:

- **HttpClient**: `post_json()`, `get()`, `post_form()`
- **FileSystem**: `read_to_string()`, `write_string()`, `append_string()`, `exists()`, `list_dir()`, `create_dir_all()`, `remove_file()`, `glob()`
- **Environment**: `var()`, `home_dir()`, `current_dir()`, `now()`, `platform()`
- **ProcessSpawner**: `exec()` (native only)

Native implementations wrap reqwest, std::fs, std::env, tokio::process. WASM implementations are stubs (Phase 4 work).

### 6-Stage Pluggable Pipeline

The agent loop uses a pipeline architecture where each stage is pluggable:

| Stage | Trait | Level 0 (no ruvector) | Level 1+ (ruvector) |
|-------|-------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Classify | `TaskClassifier` | `KeywordClassifier` (regex) | `ruvllm::TaskComplexityAnalyzer` (7-factor) |
| 2. Route | `ModelRouter` | `StaticRouter` (config.json) | `HnswRouter` + `FastGRNN` |
| 3. Context | `ContextAssembler` | `TokenBudgetAssembler` (truncate) | `AttentionAssembler` (Flash, MoE) |
| 4. Transport | `LlmTransport` | `OpenAiCompatTransport` (clawft-llm) | Same |
| 5. Score | `QualityScorer` | `NoopScorer` | `ruvllm::QualityScoringEngine` |
| 6. Learn | `LearningBackend` | `NoopLearner` | `sona::SonaEngine` (micro-LoRA) |

### Channel Plugin Architecture

All channels implement the `Channel` trait (`name()`, `start()`, `send()`, `is_running()`). The plugin host manages lifecycle, message routing, and error recovery. Channels are registered at compile time via feature flags.

| Plugin | Feature Flag | Transport |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Telegram | `channel-telegram` | HTTP long-polling + REST |
| Slack | `channel-slack` | Socket Mode WebSocket + REST |
| Discord | `channel-discord` | Gateway WebSocket + REST |

### Tool Trait

All tools implement `Tool` trait: `name()`, `description()`, `parameters()` (JSON Schema), `execute()`.

| Tool | Feature | WASM |
|------|---------|------|
| read_file, write_file, edit_file, list_dir | always | WASIp2 only |
| exec (shell) | `tool-exec` / `native-exec` | No |
| web_search, web_fetch | `tool-web` | Yes (HTTP) |
| message | always | Yes |
| spawn | `tool-spawn` | No |
| cron | `tool-cron` | Partial |
| MCP client | - | Partial |

### LLM Provider Support

**clawft-llm** is a standalone library providing:
- 4 native providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Gemini
- Config-driven `OpenAiCompatProvider` for any provider (Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, OpenRouter, Together, Fireworks, Perplexity, xAI, Ollama, Azure)
- Full SSE streaming, tool calling, 4 failover strategies
- Lock-free CircuitBreaker (WASM-safe)
- Cost tracking with real pricing data

### Feature Flag Strategy

```
Default:   channel-telegram + all-tools        (~5 MB binary)
ruvector:  + agentdb + routing + sona + attention  (~8-12 MB binary)
minimal:   channel-telegram only               (~3-4 MB binary)
WASM:      micro-hnsw + temporal-tensor + sona  (< 300 KB)
```

### Binary Size Targets

| Configuration | Target (stripped) |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Minimal (Telegram only) | ~3-4 MB |
| Default (all channels + ruvector) | ~8-12 MB |
| WASM core (uncompressed) | < 300 KB |
| WASM core (gzipped) | < 120 KB |

---

## 3. RVF Integration Scope

### What RVF Provides

RVF (RuVector Format) is a universal binary substrate merging vector database, model routing, progressive indexing, and WASM runtime. A single `.rvf` file stores agent memory embeddings, session state, routing policies, and can run queries via a < 8 KB WASM microkernel.

### Five Intelligence Levels

**Level 0 (no ruvector)**: Static registry routing, same as Python nanobot.
- Hardcoded model-to-provider mapping
- Substring memory search
- Token-count context truncation

**Level 1 (ruvllm)**: Complexity-aware routing.
- 7-factor task complexity analysis
- Routes simple tasks to cheaper models, complex tasks to capable ones
- HNSW pattern matching (150x faster than linear scan)

**Level 2 (+ tiny-dancer)**: Neural routing with resilience.
- Sub-ms neural inference for provider selection via FastGRNN
- CircuitBreaker detects provider failures, auto-routes around them
- Uncertainty estimation prevents low-confidence routing

**Level 3 (+ sona)**: Self-learning routing.
- Micro-LoRA (rank-2) instant per-request adaptation
- Base LoRA (rank-8) hourly background consolidation
- EWC++ prevents catastrophic forgetting
- ReasoningBank stores task-outcome trajectories

**Level 4 (+ attention + temporal-tensor)**: Intelligent context management.
- 40+ attention mechanisms (Flash, MoE, InformationBottleneck)
- Auto-tiered quantization: hot=fp16, warm=PQ (16x), cold=binary (32x)
- Memory footprint: ~2 MB for 10K entries with typical distribution

**Level 5 (+ graph + domain-expansion)**: Knowledge fabric.
- Property graph of skills, tools, relationships
- Multi-hop reasoning across knowledge base
- Cross-domain transfer learning

### RVF Segment Types Used

| Segment | Code | Use |
|---------|------|-----|
| VEC | 0x01 | Memory embeddings, session embeddings |
| INDEX | 0x02 | HNSW adjacency for fast search |
| META | 0x07 | Key-value metadata |
| HOT | 0x08 | Frequently-accessed entries |
| SKETCH | 0x09 | Access frequency tracking |
| WITNESS | 0x0A | Audit trail of agent actions |
| POLICY_KERNEL | 0x31 | Model routing policy parameters |
| COST_CURVE | 0x32 | Provider cost/latency/quality curves |

### Integration Points in clawft

1. **clawft-core/memory**: `MemoryStore` uses `RvfVectorStore` for semantic search over MEMORY.md
2. **clawft-core/session**: `SessionManager` indexes session summaries for semantic retrieval
3. **clawft-core/routing**: `IntelligentRouter` uses POLICY_KERNEL + COST_CURVE for learned routing
4. **clawft-core/agent**: Witness log tracks agent actions via WITNESS segments

### rvf-wasm Microkernel

< 8 KB WASM binary with 14 C-ABI exports: `rvf_init`, `rvf_load_query`, `rvf_load_block`, `rvf_distances`, `rvf_topk_merge`, `rvf_topk_read`, etc. Provides vector search in WASM without the full rvf-runtime.

### MCP Server Bridge (Future)

RVF includes `rvf-mcp-server` with 9 tools: create_store, open_store, ingest, query, status, delete, compact, delete_filter, list_stores. Could expose vector store operations as MCP tools to LLMs.

### Development Timeline (from 04-rvf-integration.md, lines 340-351)

| Week | Task | Stream |
|------|------|--------|
| 7 | Add rvf-runtime + rvf-types as workspace deps (feature-gated) | 2B |
| 8 | MemoryStore: integrate RvfVectorStore for semantic search | 2B |
| 8 | IntelligentRouter: basic pattern-matched routing | 2B |
| 9 | SessionManager: index session turns in rvf | 2B |
| 10 | IntelligentRouter: learned routing policies | 2B |
| 11 | WitnessLog: audit trail via rvf WITNESS segments | 2B |
| 11 | First-startup memory indexing from existing MEMORY.md | 2B |
| 13 | WASM: integrate rvf-wasm microkernel for vector ops | 3A |

### Embedding Strategy

- **MVP**: LLM-generated embeddings via provider's embedding endpoint (e.g., text-embedding-3-small). ~100ms per embedding, no binary size impact.
- **Fallback**: `HashEmbedding` for development/testing (not semantic).
- **Future**: Local ONNX model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), adds ~20 MB, feature-gated.

| `ruvector-filter` | Metadata filtering for vector queries | ~30 KB | Native only |
| `ruvector-metrics` | Performance metrics collection | ~20 KB | Good |

### Tier 2: Valuable Extensions (Phase 2-3)

| Crate | Purpose | Binary Impact | WASM |
|-------|---------|--------------|------|
| `ruvector-graph` | Property graph + Cypher + RAG + multi-hop reasoning | ~500 KB | graph-wasm variant |
| `ruvector-temporal-tensor` | Tiered quantization (8/7/5/3 bit), zero deps | < 10 KB | Perfect |
| `cognitum-gate-kernel` | no_std coherence gate tile | < 10 KB | Perfect |
| `ruvector-domain-expansion` | Cross-domain transfer learning | < 50 KB | Excellent |
| `ruvector-nervous-system-wasm` | Bio-inspired BTSP, HDC, WTA | < 100 KB | Excellent |
| `rvlite` | WASM vector DB with SQL/Cypher/SPARQL | ~200-500 KB | Excellent (browser) |
| `ruvllm-wasm` | Standalone WASM routing + chat templates | ~50-200 KB | Excellent |

### Tier 3: Future / Distributed (Post-Phase 3)

`ruvector-raft`, `ruvector-cluster`, `ruvector-replication`, `mcp-gate`, `prime-radiant`, `ruvector-gnn`

### WASM Size Budget

| Component | Estimated Size |
|-----------|---------------|
| clawft-core (agent loop, context, tools) | ~100 KB |
| micro-hnsw-wasm | 11.8 KB |
| ruvector-temporal-tensor (ffi) | < 10 KB |
| cognitum-gate-kernel | < 10 KB |
| sona (wasm subset) | ~30 KB |
| rvf-types | ~30 KB |
| reqwest (wasm) or manual HTTP | ~50 KB |
| **Total** | **~242 KB** (under 300 KB budget) |

### Key Design Principle

ruvector provides **routing intelligence** (the navigator). clawft-llm provides **HTTP transport** (the ship). They are separate concerns: ruvector decides *which* model to call; clawft-llm makes the actual HTTP request.

## 7. Key Architecture Decisions

### AD-1: Standalone Workspace

clawft lives in `repos/nanobot/clawft/`, separate from the barni Cargo workspace at `barni/src/`. This avoids coupling and allows independent versioning.

### AD-2: clawft-llm as Standalone Library

The LLM provider layer was extracted from barni-providers into a standalone library. It provides only HTTP transport; intelligence wrapping lives in clawft-core. Total internalization from barni: ~415 lines of CircuitBreaker + UUID newtypes converted to generic `Option<String>` metadata.

### AD-3: Pipeline Traits in clawft-core, Not clawft-llm

The 6-stage pipeline architecture lives in clawft-core. clawft-llm provides only `LlmTransport` implementations. This separation keeps the standalone library focused on HTTP while clawft-core owns intelligence orchestration.

### AD-4: Feature-Gated Ruvector

All ruvector intelligence is opt-in via feature flags. Without `ruvector`, clawft falls back to static routing (same as Python nanobot). This keeps the default binary small (~5 MB).

### AD-5: Plugin Architecture for Channels

Every channel is a plugin implementing the `Channel` trait. No channel logic in core. Compile-time registration via feature flags, not runtime dynamic loading.

### AD-6: Config Compatibility

clawft reads `~/.clawft/config.json` with automatic fallback to `~/.nanobot/config.json`. Workspace directory follows the same pattern. serde annotations use `#[serde(default)]` to match Python's defaults.

### AD-7: Dual-Target (Native + WASM)

Platform abstraction traits enable the same agent loop to run native (via reqwest/tokio) or WASM (via WASI). The WASM build uses standalone reimplementation pattern (purpose-built minimal core, not feature-flagged subset).

### AD-8: WASM Allocator

Changed from `talc` to `dlmalloc` for WASM target. The `dlmalloc` crate is well-tested for wasm32 targets.

### AD-9: WASM Target

Primary: `wasm32-wasip2` (requires Rust 1.87+, now available with 1.93.1 upgrade). Fallback: `wasm32-wasip1` (current working target). Runtime targets: WAMR (IoT), Wasmtime (edge/cloud).

### AD-10: litellm-rs Rejected as Direct Dependency

Assessed as too heavy (pulls actix-web, tokio-full), not WASM-compatible, and too young (7 months, 17 stars). Same API patterns adopted as traits instead. Could be plugged in as optional `SidecarTransport` backend in the future.

### AD-11: Security Hardening (Phase 3)

- CommandPolicy: Allowlist mode for shell command execution
- UrlPolicy: SSRF protection for web_fetch and web_search tools
- Both wired into tool implementations and CLI entry points

### AD-12: Rust Toolchain

MSRV: Rust 1.85+ (edition 2024). Currently upgrading to 1.93.1, which unblocks wasm32-wasip2 support.
