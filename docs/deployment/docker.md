# Docker Deployment

clawft ships as a minimal `FROM scratch` Docker image containing only the
statically-linked `weft` binary. The resulting image is typically around 5 MB.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) 20.10 or later

## Quick Start

Pull the pre-built image and run the gateway:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/clawft/clawft:latest
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/clawft/clawft:latest --version
```

By default the container starts in gateway mode (`weft gateway`).

## Building from Source

Clone the repository and build a static musl binary, then build the Docker
image:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawft/clawft.git
cd clawft

# Build the static binary (requires musl target)
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Prepare the Docker build context
mkdir -p docker-build
cp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/weft docker-build/weft-linux-x86_64

# Build the image
docker build -t clawft:local .
```

## Configuration

### Mounting a Config File

The container expects configuration at `/root/.clawft/config.json`. Mount your
local config into the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.clawft:/root/.clawft:ro" \
  ghcr.io/clawft/clawft:latest gateway
```

### Environment Variables

Pass API keys and settings via environment variables:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." \
  -e CLAWFT_CONFIG="/root/.clawft/config.json" \
  -v "$HOME/.clawft:/root/.clawft:ro" \
  ghcr.io/clawft/clawft:latest gateway
```

### Workspace Persistence

To persist agent session data across container restarts, mount the workspace
directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.clawft:/root/.clawft" \
  ghcr.io/clawft/clawft:latest gateway
```

## Docker Compose

A Docker Compose configuration for running the gateway with persistent storage:

```yaml
services:
  clawft:
    image: ghcr.io/clawft/clawft:latest
    command: ["gateway"]
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./config.json:/root/.clawft/config.json:ro
      - clawft-data:/root/.clawft/workspace
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "/usr/local/bin/weft", "status"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3

volumes:
  clawft-data:
```

Start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f clawft
```

## Health Checks

The `weft status` command returns a non-zero exit code if the agent cannot
initialise. Use it as a Docker health check (shown in the Compose example
above) or probe it manually:

```bash
docker exec <container> /usr/local/bin/weft status
```

## Security Considerations

The `FROM scratch` image has no shell, no package manager, and no OS libraries
-- the attack surface is minimal. For additional hardening:

- **Read-only filesystem**: mount the config volume as `:ro` and use a named
  volume for workspace data.
- **Non-root execution**: the `scratch` image has no users, so the process runs
  as UID 0 inside a minimal namespace. For stricter isolation, run with
  `--user 1000:1000` and adjust volume permissions accordingly.
- **Network restrictions**: use `--network=none` for offline testing, or create
  a dedicated Docker network to restrict egress.
- **Secrets**: never bake API keys into the image. Pass them via environment
  variables or Docker secrets.

## Troubleshooting

**Container exits immediately**

Check that the config file is valid JSON and the volume mount path is correct:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$HOME/.clawft:/root/.clawft:ro" \
  ghcr.io/clawft/clawft:latest status --detailed
```

**Permission denied on config file**

Ensure the config file is readable by the container user. On Linux:

```bash
chmod 644 ~/.clawft/config.json
```

**Cannot reach LLM API**

Verify DNS and network access from the container:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/clawft/clawft:latest agent -m "ping"
```

If running behind a corporate proxy, pass proxy environment variables:

```bash
docker run --rm -e HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy:8080" ...
```

## CI/CD Pipeline (K2)

clawft uses a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-gates.yml`) to
enforce quality gates on every pull request. The pipeline also supports
multi-arch Docker image builds for releases.

### PR Gate Jobs

Every pull request must pass all of the following jobs before merge:

| Job | Command | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| **Clippy lint** | `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` | Zero-warning clippy across all crates |
| **Test suite** | `cargo test --workspace` | Full workspace test suite |
| **WASM size gate** | `scripts/bench/wasm-size-gate.sh` | Assert WASM binary < 300 KB raw, < 120 KB gzipped |
| **Binary size check** | `wc -c target/release/weft` | Assert release binary < 10 MB |
| **Integration smoke** | Docker build + gateway start | Build image, start gateway, verify it runs for 5s |

The pipeline uses `concurrency` groups to cancel stale runs when new commits
are pushed to the same PR branch.

### Clippy Gate

Clippy runs with `-D warnings` (deny all warnings), which means any new
warning introduced by a PR will fail the build:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
```

### Test Gate

The full workspace test suite runs without feature flags to catch regressions
in the default build:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### WASM Size Assertion

The WASM size gate builds the `clawft-wasm` crate with the `release-wasm`
profile and checks both raw and gzipped sizes:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --profile release-wasm -p clawft-wasm
bash scripts/bench/wasm-size-gate.sh "$WASM_BINARY" 300 120
```

The `release-wasm` profile uses `opt-level = "z"` for aggressive size
optimization. The CI job also installs `binaryen` for `wasm-opt`.

### Binary Size Check

The release binary must stay under 10 MB:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin weft
SIZE_BYTES=$(wc -c < target/release/weft)
# Fail if > 10 MB
```

A size report is posted to the GitHub Actions step summary for visibility.

### Multi-Arch Docker Release

The CI pipeline supports multi-architecture Docker image builds:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t weft .
```

The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build with `cargo-chef` for dependency
caching:

1. **Chef stage**: Install `cargo-chef` for dependency recipe extraction
2. **Planner stage**: Generate the dependency recipe from `Cargo.toml`
3. **Builder stage**: Cook dependencies (cached layer), then build the app
4. **Runtime stage**: `debian:bookworm-slim` with only the stripped binary

The runtime image includes `ca-certificates`, `libssl3`, and `libgcc-s1`
(required by wasmtime). It runs as a non-root `weft` user.

### Docker Image Variants

| Variant | Base | Features | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|----------|
| Default | `debian:bookworm-slim` | Standard build | Production gateway |
| WASM-enabled | `debian:bookworm-slim` | `--features wasm-plugins` | Plugins support |
| Minimal | `debian:bookworm-slim` | `--no-default-features` | Smallest image, no delegation |

To build with WASM plugin support:

```bash
docker build --build-arg FEATURES="wasm-plugins" -t weft:wasm .
```

### Integration Smoke Test

The smoke test job runs after the test suite passes:

1. Build a Docker image using `docker/build-push-action@v6` with GHA cache
2. Start the container in gateway mode (`weft gateway`)
3. Wait 5 seconds and verify the container is still running
4. Shut down the container

This catches issues like missing runtime dependencies, incorrect entrypoint
configuration, or crash-on-startup bugs that unit tests cannot detect.
