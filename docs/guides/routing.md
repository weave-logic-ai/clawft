# Routing and Pipeline Guide

This guide covers the 6-stage processing pipeline, how requests are classified
and routed to LLM providers, how context assembly and quality scoring work,
and the planned upgrades at each intelligence level.

---

## 1. Overview

Every incoming message passes through a **6-stage pipeline** before a response
is produced. Each stage is defined as a trait object held in an `Arc<dyn T>`,
making stages independently replaceable at compile time (via feature flags) or
at runtime (via `set_pipeline()`).

A `PipelineRegistry` maps `TaskType` variants to specialized `Pipeline`
instances. When no specialized pipeline is registered for a task type, the
registry falls back to the default pipeline. The registry's `complete()` method
orchestrates the full flow and feeds the resulting `Trajectory` back into the
`LearningBackend`.

The current Level 0 implementation ships with simple, zero-dependency defaults
for every stage. Higher-level implementations are activated by feature flags
(`vector-memory`, and planned flags for `ruvllm`, `tiny-dancer`, `sona`,
`attention`, `temporal-tensor`, `graph`, and `domain-expansion`).

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "6-Stage Pipeline"
        C[Classifier] --> R[Router] --> A[Assembler] --> T[Transport] --> S[Scorer] --> L[Learner]
    end

    IN["ChatRequest"] --> C
    L --> OUT["LlmResponse"]

    C -- "TaskProfile\n(type, complexity)" --> R
    R -- "RoutingDecision\n(provider, model)" --> A
    A -- "AssembledContext\n(messages, token_estimate)" --> T
    T -- "LlmResponse" --> S
    S -- "QualityScore\n(overall, relevance, coherence)" --> L
    L -- "Trajectory" --> L
```

The `Pipeline` struct bundles all six stages:

```rust
pub struct Pipeline {
    pub classifier: Arc<dyn TaskClassifier>,
    pub router:     Arc<dyn ModelRouter>,
    pub assembler:  Arc<dyn ContextAssembler>,
    pub transport:  Arc<dyn LlmTransport>,
    pub scorer:     Arc<dyn QualityScorer>,
    pub learner:    Arc<dyn LearningBackend>,
}
```

And `PipelineRegistry` maps task types to pipelines:

```rust
pub struct PipelineRegistry {
    pipelines: HashMap<TaskType, Pipeline>,
    default: Pipeline,
}
```

Calling `registry.complete(request)` runs all six stages in sequence and
returns the `LlmResponse`.

---

## 3. Stage-by-Stage Breakdown

### Stage 1: Classifier (`TaskClassifier`)

The classifier examines the incoming `ChatRequest` and produces a `TaskProfile`
containing a detected `TaskType` and an estimated complexity score.

**Trait:**

```rust
pub trait TaskClassifier: Send + Sync {
    fn classify(&self, request: &ChatRequest) -> TaskProfile;
}
```

**Supporting types:**

```rust
pub struct TaskProfile {
    pub task_type:  TaskType,
    pub complexity: f32,       // 0.0..1.0
    pub keywords:   Vec<String>,
}

pub enum TaskType {
    Chat, CodeGeneration, CodeReview, Research,
    Creative, Analysis, ToolUse, Unknown,
}
```

**Current implementation: `KeywordClassifier`**

The Level 0 classifier scans the last user message (ignoring system messages)
for keyword patterns using case-insensitive substring matching. Patterns are
checked in priority order -- the first matching group determines the task type:

| Priority | Keywords | Task Type |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | code, function, implement, debug, fix, program, script, compile, refactor, class, struct, module | `CodeGeneration` |
| 2 | review, check, audit, lint, inspect | `CodeReview` |
| 3 | search, find, research, look up, lookup, discover | `Research` |
| 4 | write, story, poem, creative, compose, draft, narrative | `Creative` |
| 5 | analyze, explain, summarize, compare, evaluate, assess | `Analysis` |
| 6 | use tool, run tool, execute, call function | `ToolUse` |

If no keywords match, the task defaults to `Chat`.

**Complexity heuristic:** `matched_keywords.len() / word_count`, clamped to
the range [0.1, 0.9]. More keyword hits relative to message length produce a
higher complexity estimate.

**Planned upgrades:**

- Level 1 (`ruvllm`): 7-factor complexity scoring with HNSW-accelerated
  embedding comparison.
- Level 2 (`tiny-dancer`): Sub-millisecond neural classification.

---

### Stage 2: Router (`ModelRouter`)

The router selects a provider and model for the classified task.

**Trait:**

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait ModelRouter: Send + Sync {
    async fn route(&self, request: &ChatRequest, profile: &TaskProfile) -> RoutingDecision;
    fn update(&self, decision: &RoutingDecision, outcome: &ResponseOutcome);
}
```

**Supporting types:**

```rust
pub struct RoutingDecision {
    pub provider: String,   // e.g. "openai", "anthropic"
    pub model:    String,   // e.g. "gpt-4o", "claude-opus-4-5"
    pub reason:   String,
}

pub struct ResponseOutcome {
    pub success:    bool,
    pub quality:    QualityScore,
    pub latency_ms: u64,
}
```

**Current implementation: `StaticRouter`**

The Level 0 router parses the `"provider/model"` string from
`config.agents.defaults.model` (e.g. `"anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"`) and always
returns that pair. If no slash is present, the provider defaults to `"openai"`.
The `update()` method is a no-op.

**Upgrade: `TieredRouter` (Level 1)** -- see Section 5a below.

**Planned upgrade: `IntelligentRouter` (Level 2)** -- see Section 5.

---

### Stage 3: Assembler (`ContextAssembler`)

The assembler takes the full conversation history and trims it to fit within a
token budget, producing an `AssembledContext` ready for transport.

**Trait:**

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait ContextAssembler: Send + Sync {
    async fn assemble(&self, request: &ChatRequest, profile: &TaskProfile) -> AssembledContext;
}
```

**Supporting types:**

```rust
pub struct AssembledContext {
    pub messages:       Vec<LlmMessage>,
    pub token_estimate: usize,
    pub truncated:      bool,
}
```

**Current implementation: `TokenBudgetAssembler`**

Token estimation uses a `content.len() / 4 + 4` heuristic (4 tokens of
overhead per message for role and structure).

Truncation strategy:

1. Always keep the first message (typically the system prompt).
2. Walk backwards from the most recent message, adding messages until the
   budget is exhausted.
3. Middle messages are dropped.
4. A single message that exceeds the entire budget is included anyway.

The `profile` parameter is ignored at Level 0.

**Planned upgrades:**

- Level 1: Task-aware budget allocation (more tokens for code, fewer for chat).
- Level 2: Semantic compression of older messages before truncation.

---

### Stage 4: Transport (`LlmTransport`)

The transport sends the assembled request to an LLM provider and returns
the response.

**Trait:**

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait LlmTransport: Send + Sync {
    async fn complete(&self, request: &TransportRequest) -> Result<LlmResponse>;
}
```

**Supporting types:**

```rust
pub struct TransportRequest {
    pub provider:    String,
    pub model:       String,
    pub messages:    Vec<LlmMessage>,
    pub tools:       Vec<serde_json::Value>,
    pub max_tokens:  Option<i32>,
    pub temperature: Option<f64>,
}
```

**Current implementation: `OpenAiCompatTransport`**

Operates in two modes:

- **Stub mode** (`OpenAiCompatTransport::new()`): Returns a
  `ClawftError::Provider` error on every call. Used during development or when
  no provider is configured.
- **Provider mode** (`OpenAiCompatTransport::with_provider(provider)`): Wraps
  an `Arc<dyn LlmProvider>` and makes real HTTP calls.

The `enable_live_llm()` method on `AppContext` replaces the stub transport
with a live `ClawftLlmAdapter` backed by a `clawft_llm::Provider`. The adapter
converts between the pipeline's `TransportRequest` format and `clawft-llm`'s
typed `ChatRequest`/`ChatResponse`, routing through
`OpenAiCompatProvider` to the configured API endpoint.

The response parser handles both text completions and tool calls, extracting
content blocks, stop reason, and usage statistics from the OpenAI-format JSON.

---

### Stage 5: Scorer (`QualityScorer`)

The scorer assesses the quality of the response.

**Trait:**

```rust
pub trait QualityScorer: Send + Sync {
    fn score(&self, request: &ChatRequest, response: &LlmResponse) -> QualityScore;
}
```

**Supporting types:**

```rust
pub struct QualityScore {
    pub overall:   f32,    // 0.0..1.0
    pub relevance: f32,    // 0.0..1.0
    pub coherence: f32,    // 0.0..1.0
}
```

**Current implementation: `NoopScorer`**

Returns 1.0 for all three dimensions on every call. Input and response content
are completely ignored.

**Planned upgrades:**

- Level 1 (`ruvllm`): 5-dimension scoring -- accuracy, relevance, completeness,
  coherence, and safety.
- Level 2 (`tiny-dancer`): Neural quality model with confidence estimation.

---

### Stage 6: Learner (`LearningBackend`)

The learner records complete interaction trajectories for future improvement.

**Trait:**

```rust
pub trait LearningBackend: Send + Sync {
    fn record(&self, trajectory: &Trajectory);
    fn adapt(&self, signal: &LearningSignal);
}
```

**Supporting types:**

```rust
pub struct Trajectory {
    pub request:  ChatRequest,
    pub routing:  RoutingDecision,
    pub response: LlmResponse,
    pub quality:  QualityScore,
}

pub struct LearningSignal {
    pub feedback_type: String,   // e.g. "thumbs_up", "thumbs_down", "correction"
    pub value:         f32,      // -1.0..1.0
}
```

**Current implementation: `NoopLearner`**

Both `record()` and `adapt()` silently discard all data.

**Planned upgrades (`sona`):**

- Micro-LoRA: Per-request gradient-free adaptation.
- Base-LoRA: Hourly aggregated parameter updates.
- EWC++: Weekly elastic weight consolidation to prevent catastrophic forgetting.
- ReasoningBank: Persistent store of successful reasoning traces for retrieval.

## 4. Message Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Channel as Channel Plugin
    participant Bus as MessageBus
    participant Agent as AgentLoop
    participant Session as SessionManager
    participant Context as ContextBuilder
    participant Registry as PipelineRegistry
    participant Tools as ToolRegistry

    Channel->>Bus: publish_inbound(InboundMessage)
    Bus->>Agent: consume_inbound()
    Agent->>Session: get_or_create("channel:chat_id")
    Session-->>Agent: Session
    Agent->>Context: build_messages(session, skills)
    Context-->>Agent: Vec<LlmMessage>
    Agent->>Registry: complete(ChatRequest)

    Note over Registry: 1. Classifier: ChatRequest -> TaskProfile
    Note over Registry: 2. Router: TaskProfile -> RoutingDecision
    Note over Registry: 3. Assembler: ChatRequest + TaskProfile -> AssembledContext
    Note over Registry: 4. Transport: TransportRequest -> LlmResponse
    Note over Registry: 5. Scorer: ChatRequest + LlmResponse -> QualityScore
    Note over Registry: 6. Learner: record(Trajectory)

    Registry-->>Agent: LlmResponse

    alt Response contains ToolUse blocks
        loop up to max_tool_iterations
            Agent->>Tools: execute(tool_name, args)
            Tools-->>Agent: Result<Value> (truncated to 64KB)
            Agent->>Registry: complete(ChatRequest + tool results)
            Registry-->>Agent: LlmResponse
        end
    end

    Agent->>Session: save_session(session)
    Agent->>Bus: dispatch_outbound(OutboundMessage)
    Bus->>Channel: consume_outbound()
    Channel->>Channel: send(OutboundMessage)
```

When `PipelineRegistry::complete()` runs, it:

1. Classifies the request using the **default** pipeline's classifier.
2. Looks up the specialized pipeline for that `TaskType` (falls back to
   default if none is registered).
3. Runs stages 2-6 using the selected pipeline.
4. Calls `router.update()` with the outcome after the response is scored.

---

## 5a. TieredRouter and Permission-Based Routing (Level 1)

The `TieredRouter` replaces the `StaticRouter` when `routing.mode` is set to
`"tiered"` in the configuration. It selects models based on task complexity,
user permissions, and cost budgets.

Source: `crates/clawft-core/src/pipeline/tiered_router.rs`,
`crates/clawft-core/src/pipeline/permissions.rs`

### How It Works

When a `ChatRequest` enters the pipeline, the `TieredRouter` executes an
8-step routing algorithm:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[1. Extract AuthContext] --> B[2. Read permissions]
    B --> C{3. Rate limit check}
    C -->|exceeded| F1[Return fallback]
    C -->|ok| D[4. Filter tiers by max_tier]
    D --> E{5. Select tier by complexity}
    E --> G{Escalation needed?}
    G -->|yes, 3 conditions met| H[Promote to next tier]
    G -->|no| I[Use selected tier]
    H --> J{6. Budget check}
    I --> J
    J -->|over budget| K[Downgrade to cheaper tier]
    J -->|ok| L[7. Select model from tier]
    K --> L
    L --> M[8. Record estimated cost]
```

### AuthContext and Permission Resolution

Every request carries an `AuthContext` (sender_id, channel, permissions).
The `AgentLoop` creates this from the inbound message:

- **CLI channel** -> `admin` (Level 2, full access)
- **All other channels** -> `zero_trust` (Level 0, free tier only)

Permissions are resolved through a 5-layer merge (lowest to highest priority):

| Priority | Layer | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 (lowest) | Built-in defaults | `zero_trust_defaults()`, `user_defaults()`, `admin_defaults()` |
| 2 | Global config | `routing.permissions.zero_trust`, `.user`, `.admin` |
| 3 | Workspace config | Project-local `.clawft/config.json` routing section |
| 4 | Per-user override | `routing.permissions.users.{sender_id}` |
| 5 (highest) | Per-channel override | `routing.permissions.channels.{channel}` |

Each layer can override any dimension independently. For example, a per-user
override can set `"level": 2` without specifying `max_tier` -- the `max_tier`
is inherited from the admin defaults.

### Granting Permissions

**Grant a specific user admin access:**
```json
{
  "routing": {
    "permissions": {
      "users": {
        "alice_telegram_123": { "level": 2 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Grant an entire channel higher access:**
```json
{
  "routing": {
    "permissions": {
      "channels": {
        "telegram": { "level": 1 },
        "slack": { "level": 1 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Grant a user access to specific tools only:**
```json
{
  "routing": {
    "permissions": {
      "users": {
        "bob_discord_456": {
          "level": 1,
          "tool_access": ["read_file", "list_dir", "web_search"],
          "cost_budget_daily_usd": 2.00
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Permission Levels

| Level | Name | Default `max_tier` | Tool Access | Rate Limit | Budget |
|-------|------|-------------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 0 | `zero_trust` | `free` | None | 10/min | $0.10/day |
| 1 | `user` | `standard` | 7 safe tools | 60/min | $5.00/day |
| 2 | `admin` | `elite` | All (`*`) | Unlimited | Unlimited |

### 16 Permission Dimensions

Each dimension is independently configurable per level, user, or channel:

| Dimension | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `level` | integer | Permission level (0, 1, 2) |
| `max_tier` | string | Maximum model tier accessible |
| `model_access` | string[] | Model allowlist (globs: `"anthropic/*"`) |
| `model_denylist` | string[] | Model denylist |
| `tool_access` | string[] | Tool allowlist (`["*"]` = all) |
| `tool_denylist` | string[] | Tool denylist |
| `max_context_tokens` | integer | Max input tokens |
| `max_output_tokens` | integer | Max output tokens |
| `rate_limit` | integer | Requests per window (0 = unlimited) |
| `streaming_allowed` | boolean | SSE streaming allowed |
| `escalation_allowed` | boolean | Complexity escalation allowed |
| `escalation_threshold` | float | Escalation trigger point (0.0-1.0) |
| `model_override` | boolean | User can override model selection |
| `cost_budget_daily_usd` | float | Daily budget (0.0 = unlimited) |
| `cost_budget_monthly_usd` | float | Monthly budget (0.0 = unlimited) |
| `custom_permissions` | object | Plugin-defined extensions |

### Tier Selection

The router selects the highest-quality tier the user can afford:

1. Filter tiers where the user's `max_tier` ordinal >= tier ordinal.
2. From allowed tiers, find those whose `complexity_range` contains the task
   complexity.
3. Pick the tier with the highest cost (best quality).
4. If no tier matches and escalation is enabled (3 conditions: user allows it,
   config enables it, complexity > threshold), promote to the next tier above
   `max_tier`.

### Model Selection Strategies

Within a chosen tier, the model is selected by one of four strategies:

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `preference_order` | First model in the tier's `models` list (default) |
| `round_robin` | Atomic counter rotates through models across requests |
| `lowest_cost` | First model (tiers sorted by cost) |
| `random` | Hash-based deterministic selection |

### Cost Tracking

The `CostTracker` maintains per-user daily and monthly spend:

- `reserve_budget()` atomically checks and reserves cost before routing
  (prevents TOCTOU races)
- `reconcile_actual()` adjusts spend after the LLM response (actual vs.
  estimated)
- Zero budget (0.0) means unlimited
- Spend resets at `reset_hour_utc` daily
- Persistence via atomic JSON file with 0600 permissions

When a user exceeds their budget, the router downgrades to a cheaper tier.
If all tiers are exhausted, the `fallback_model` is used (if permitted by
the user's `max_tier`).

### Rate Limiting

The `RateLimiter` enforces per-user request limits:

- Two-stage check: global counter (AtomicU64) first, then per-user sliding
  window
- LRU eviction when tracking > 10,000 users
- When rate limited, the router returns the fallback model (if permitted)

### Workspace Ceiling Enforcement

When a workspace config overrides routing permissions, the
`PermissionResolver` enforces ceilings:

- Workspace cannot grant a level above `max_grantable_level` (default: 1)
- Workspace cannot enable escalation if global disables it
- Workspace cannot increase rate limits beyond global
- Workspace cannot increase cost budgets beyond global
- Workspace cannot grant wildcard tool access if global doesn't

This prevents a malicious `.clawft/config.json` from escalating privileges.

### Configuration

See the [Configuration Reference](../reference/config.md#routing) for the
full JSON schema, defaults, and examples.

### Security: AuthContext Injection Prevention

The `auth_context` field on `ChatRequest` is annotated with
`#[serde(skip_deserializing)]`. This means:

- The field is populated server-side by the `AgentLoop`, not from user input
- JSON payloads sent through the gateway API cannot inject an `auth_context`
- Even if a user includes `"auth_context": {"level": 2}` in their request
  JSON, it is silently dropped during deserialization

## 5. IntelligentRouter and 3-Tier Routing

The `IntelligentRouter` is gated behind the `vector-memory` feature flag and
implements 3-tier routing per ADR-026. It replaces the `StaticRouter` when
the feature is enabled.

### Routing Algorithm

The router evaluates three rules in order, taking the first match:

1. **Agent Booster tag check**: If `RoutingContext.tags` contains
   `"AGENT_BOOSTER_AVAILABLE"`, route to Tier 1 immediately.
2. **Policy cache lookup**: Embed the prompt and search the vector store for
   cached routing decisions. If the best match has a similarity score above
   0.85, use the cached tier.
3. **Complexity scoring**: Compute a heuristic complexity score and route
   based on threshold:
   - complexity < 0.30 -> Tier 2
   - complexity >= 0.30 -> Tier 3

### Tier Definitions

| Tier | Model | Latency | Cost | Use Cases |
|------|-------|---------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Agent Booster (WASM) | <1ms | $0 | Simple transforms: var to const, add types, format code. Skip the LLM entirely. |
| 2 | Haiku-class | ~500ms | Low | Simple tasks, short answers, low complexity (<30%) |
| 3 | Sonnet/Opus | 2-5s | Higher | Complex reasoning, architecture, security analysis (>30%) |

### Complexity Scoring

The `compute_complexity()` function applies four heuristics:

| Factor | Calculation | Max Contribution |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Word count | `words / 1000` | 0.3 |
| Code fences | Contains ` ``` ` | +0.2 |
| Reasoning keywords | Contains "analyze", "design", "architect", "explain", or "compare" | +0.1 |
| Multi-step indicators | Contains "first", "then", "finally", or "step 1" | +0.2 |

The result is clamped to [0.0, 1.0].

### Policy Learning

Successful routing decisions are stored as vector embeddings in the policy
store. On future requests:

1. The prompt is embedded.
2. The policy store is searched for the 5 nearest neighbors.
3. If the best match has a similarity score above 0.85, the cached tier is
   reused (cache hit).
4. Failed routing decisions (where `success == false`) are not cached.

### Router Types and Methods

```rust
pub struct IntelligentRouter {
    policy_store: VectorStore,
    embedder: Box<dyn Embedder>,
    cost_records: Vec<CostRecord>,
}

impl IntelligentRouter {
    pub async fn new(embedder: Box<dyn Embedder>) -> Self;
    pub async fn route_request(&self, prompt: &str, context: &RoutingContext)
        -> Result<RoutingDecision, RoutingError>;
    pub async fn record_cost(&mut self, model: &str, tokens: u64, cost: f32, latency_ms: u64);
    pub async fn update_policy(&mut self, pattern: &str, tier: u8, success: bool);
    pub fn get_model_stats(&self, model: &str) -> ModelStats;
}
```

## 6. Progressive Intelligence Levels

Intelligence capabilities are gated behind feature flags that can be enabled
independently. Each level builds on the one below.

| Level | Feature Flags | Routing | Memory | Scoring | Learning |
|-------|---------------|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| 0 | none (default) | Static routing (always same model) | Substring memory search | NoopScorer (always 1.0) | NoopLearner (discard all) |
| 1 | `ruvllm` | 7-factor complexity, HNSW routing cache (150x faster lookup) | HNSW-indexed vector memory | 5-dimension quality scoring | EMA statistics |
| 2 | + `tiny-dancer` | Sub-ms neural routing, CircuitBreaker, uncertainty estimation | Neural-compressed memory | Neural quality model | Gradient-free adaptation |
| 3 | + `sona` | Per-request adaptation | Semantic memory consolidation | Context-aware scoring | Micro-LoRA per-request, Base-LoRA hourly, EWC++ weekly, ReasoningBank |
| 4 | + `attention` + `temporal-tensor` | Flash attention, MoE routing | Temporal-aware memory with attention | Auto-tiered quantization scoring | Mixture-of-experts learning |
| 5 | + `graph` + `domain-expansion` | Property graph routing | Multi-hop graph memory | Cross-domain scoring | Cross-domain transfer learning |

At Level 0, the only optional feature flag is `vector-memory`, which enables
the `IntelligentRouter`, `VectorStore`, and `SessionIndexer` modules.

---

## 7. Scoring and Learning

### Current State (Level 0)

- **Scoring**: `NoopScorer` returns `QualityScore { overall: 1.0, relevance: 1.0, coherence: 1.0 }` for every response. No analysis is performed.
- **Learning**: `NoopLearner` discards all `Trajectory` records and `LearningSignal` feedback. No state is persisted.

### Feedback Loop

Even at Level 0, the pipeline feeds the `Trajectory` back into the router via
`router.update()`. The `StaticRouter` ignores this call, but the
`IntelligentRouter` uses it to update its policy store (caching successful
routing decisions as vector embeddings for future reuse).

### Planned Scoring (Level 1+, `ruvllm`)

The `ruvllm` feature flag will introduce 5-dimension quality scoring:

| Dimension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Accuracy | Factual correctness of the response |
| Relevance | How well the response addresses the original request |
| Completeness | Whether all aspects of the request were addressed |
| Coherence | Logical flow and readability |
| Safety | Absence of harmful, biased, or inappropriate content |

### Planned Learning (Level 3+, `sona`)

The `sona` feature flag will introduce four learning mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Frequency | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Micro-LoRA | Per-request | Gradient-free parameter perturbation for immediate adaptation |
| Base-LoRA | Hourly | Aggregated low-rank updates from accumulated trajectories |
| EWC++ | Weekly | Elastic weight consolidation to prevent catastrophic forgetting |
| ReasoningBank | Continuous | Persistent store of successful reasoning traces, queried for similar future requests |

### Backup

Currently, the only persistent pipeline-related data is session JSONL files in
`~/.clawft/workspace/sessions/`. These are plain text and can be copied
directly for backup.

Once `.rvf` files are implemented, they will be self-contained binary files
that can be copied for backup without any export step.

## 9. Configuration

### Model Routing

The model to use is configured in `agents.defaults.model` using
`"provider/model"` syntax:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"
    }
  }
}
```

The `StaticRouter` splits this string at the first `/` to determine the
provider and model. If no slash is present, the provider defaults to `"openai"`.

Provider credentials are resolved from the `providers` config section or from
environment variables (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

See the [Configuration Guide](configuration.md) for the full provider list and
environment variable reference.

### Token Budget

The context assembler's token budget is derived from `agents.defaults.max_tokens`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "max_tokens": 8192
    }
  }
}
```

### Viewing Routing Decisions

- `weft status --detailed` shows the current routing configuration (provider,
  model, pipeline level).
- The `--verbose` flag (or `RUST_LOG=debug`) logs routing decisions at the
  debug level, including the reason field from `RoutingDecision`.
- When using the `IntelligentRouter`, `get_model_stats()` returns per-model
  analytics (total calls, total cost, average latency).

### Enabling the IntelligentRouter

Build with the `vector-memory` feature flag:

```sh
cargo build --release --features vector-memory
```

Or install with:

```sh
cargo install clawft-cli --features vector-memory
```

The `IntelligentRouter` activates automatically when `vector-memory` is
enabled. No additional configuration is required -- it uses the same
`agents.defaults.model` as the Tier 3 fallback.

## 10. Phase 3 TODO: Unimplemented Features

The following features are designed but not yet implemented. They are tracked
here as stubs for future development.

### Adaptive Classifier

- [ ] 7-factor complexity scoring (word count, vocabulary diversity, syntactic
  depth, domain specificity, ambiguity, code density, reasoning chain length)
- [ ] HNSW-indexed prompt embeddings for classification by similarity
- [ ] Confidence estimation with fallback to higher tier on low confidence

### Neural Router

- [ ] Sub-millisecond neural routing via `tiny-dancer` WASM inference
- [ ] CircuitBreaker pattern: automatic tier demotion when a provider is slow
  or erroring
- [ ] Uncertainty estimation: route to higher tier when the router is unsure

### Quality Scoring

- [ ] 5-dimension scoring (accuracy, relevance, completeness, coherence, safety)
- [ ] Heuristic baselines: response length, format compliance, tool call
  success rate
- [ ] Neural quality model with calibrated confidence scores

### Learning Backend

- [ ] Trajectory persistence to disk (JSONL or RVF format)
- [ ] Micro-LoRA per-request adaptation
- [ ] Base-LoRA hourly batch updates
- [ ] EWC++ weekly consolidation
- [ ] ReasoningBank with semantic retrieval

### Routing Policy Persistence

- [ ] Save routing policies to `~/.clawft/routing/policies.rvf`
- [ ] Load policies on startup for warm-start routing
- [ ] Policy expiration and garbage collection

### Cost Analytics

- [ ] Persist cost records across sessions
- [ ] Per-tier cost breakdown in `weft status`
- [ ] Budget alerts when cost exceeds configurable thresholds
- [ ] Cost-aware routing: prefer cheaper tiers when quality is sufficient
