//! Durable lineage manifest -- closes `BranchableMemory::open`'s documented
//! lossy-reopen gap for everything except a `working` node's uncommitted
//! (not-yet-checkpointed) edits, which are deliberately still not captured
//! here. Every topology-changing operation (`create`, `checkpoint`,
//! `rollback`, `promote`, `branch`/`fork` -- for the new lineage --,
//! `pause`, `resume`) writes a fresh manifest after it succeeds; plain
//! `ingest`/`delete` against `working` do not, by design, so a crash
//! between checkpoints still loses whatever `working` hadn't been
//! checkpointed yet.
//!
//! # What gets restored on `BranchableMemory::open`
//!
//! - The full node topology: `base`, this lineage's own checkpoint chain
//!   (`ancestors`), and anything inherited from a fork/branch source
//!   (`inherited`) -- each reopened from its own `.rvf` file (writable for
//!   `base`, read-only for everything else, matching their roles).
//! - Each node's tombstone set. This is NOT redundant with RVF's own
//!   on-disk deletion bitmap: `BranchableMemory::delete` deliberately never
//!   calls `RvfStore::delete` for a locally-present id (see its doc
//!   comment), so an ancestor's or `working`'s tombstones exist *only* at
//!   this crate-level bookkeeping layer, and would silently resurrect on
//!   reopen without this manifest.
//! - The process-wide id-counter watermarks (`CheckpointId` and vector-id
//!   allocators), bumped past whatever this lineage already used, so a
//!   freshly restarted process cannot hand out an id that collides with
//!   one already physically present in a restored `.rvf` file.
//! - The `paused` flag: a lineage parked via `BranchableMemory::pause`
//!   reopens still parked (`working` stays `None`); `resume()` afterward
//!   works exactly as it would have pre-restart.
//!
//! # What is NOT restored (documented loss, not a bug)
//!
//! - `working`'s own uncommitted edits/tombstones/texts/tags, when the
//!   lineage is reopened *not* paused -- `working` is always re-derived
//!   fresh from the restored head in that case, same as the pre-manifest
//!   `open()` behaved for `base`.
//! - Every restored node's `edit_log` (the raw ingested vector floats,
//!   kept in-process for `diff()`/`promote()`'s replay) and `texts`/`tags`.
//!   `rvf-runtime` 0.2's public `RvfStore` API has no vector-by-id getter
//!   (only `query`), so these cannot be reconstructed from the `.rvf` file
//!   alone, and this manifest does not duplicate the raw vector data to
//!   avoid doubling every lineage's on-disk footprint. Practical
//!   consequence: a restored ancestor/`base` node is fully **queryable**
//!   (the physical file has its vectors) but a restored ancestor is not
//!   **promotable** -- `promote()`'s replay reads from `edit_log`, which is
//!   empty for a just-reopened node. `texts`/`tags` were already documented
//!   as process-lifetime-only before this manifest existed (see
//!   `VectorItem::text`'s doc comment); that loss is unchanged, just now
//!   explicit here too.
